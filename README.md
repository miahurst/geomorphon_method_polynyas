# Geomorphon Pattern Recognition Algorithm for Detecting Polynyas

About: Code for how to use the geomorphon pattern recognition algorithm to identify polynyas from sea ice concentration data.

Polynyas are areas of open water surrounded by sea ice. they are critical features of polar marine systems due to their role in facilitating ocean-atmosphere heat exchange, deep water formation, nutrient cycling, and biological productivity. Current detection methods used to track their extent and distribution, which use sea ice concentration thresholds, are time consuming to use, lack automation, and often fail to capture fine-scale coastal features.

Within this GitHub repository you will find code which runs the geomorphon pattern recognition algorithm when you input sea ice concentration tif files.

To run this code you will need tif files with information on longitude, latitiude, time, and sea ice concentration data.
